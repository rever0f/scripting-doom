### the Sling

Some people like to work. Some think this is a
horrible idea. Given the choice between throwing a
rock and swinging a string somebody decided to
swing a string.

### the Wheel

Given the choice between carrying something and
having something else carry somthing somebody
decided it wasn't their job.

### Language

Given the choice between pantomime and forcing
other people to remember sounds. somebody pounded
words into somebody elses head.

### And so on

Somebody decided on a transistor, a circuit,
binary, assembly, programming and scripting.

- trasistor hold a single charge
- Circuits do computation.
- binary translates computation
- assembly translates to binary
- programming and scripting translates to assembly

### Still working

So somebody decided is wasn't there job and made
something to do it for them. Programs merely
repeat these somethings over and over for people
who would rather have it done elsewhere.

Programs are for lazy people.

Scripting is for even lazier people.

### Scripting

- Scripting is easier than coding primarily because it is not compiled.
- Compiling is usually a single command/button
- This is because doing things over and over adds up
- The difference between scripting and programming is contested and an actual definition is hard to come by but there are areas where it is done regularly
- I roughly count 3 of these

### the Server

- servers are just computers
- power users find they do many things over and over
- these thing can to some extent write small recipies so the computer does it for them
- somes times these recipies aren't so small

### the Program

- programs will some times expose certain levels of thier internal functions so they can automate tasks
- small command line programs tend to have everything exposed but thats all they do
- excell exposes some but not all of its fuctionality in a very kludgy way
-3d rendering programs take such commands to preform specific tasks
- some text editors expose every function to the user

### Every Where

Scripting languages attempt to expose the entire
computer in an 'easy' way to the user. As more
computers invade our spaces these will become more
and more accessible to scripting.

### Text Editors

Among programmers there is fierce debate about the
one true text bashing device. I suspect merely use
the one they like and expect others to do the
same. There are however to established text
editors intrinsic philosophies. Most have been
watered down over time.

### vi

vi is according to wikipedia the shortest
unambigous abbreviation for visual in ex an even
more ancient text editor. vi has descended through
many incanations to be most popular in vim.

- originally derived its power from being small and fast and powerful
- derives its power from shortest keystrokes called modes
- in vi there are several modes that make all the keys do diffent things
- it uses a scripting language based on c, an old programing language, syntax
- very accessible macros as well which limit the need for scripting

### emacs

emacs borrows letters from Editable MACroS and was
written to edit code directly as its inspiration
did. It has also had several incarnations and is
most poplar in its gnu emacs form.

- it derives its power from being powerful and exposing all its self-documenting features
- it uses what is traditionally called the kitchen sink methodology and preforms a raft of task besides text editing
- it uses a form of lisp, a very old and powerful programming language
- has another form of modes based of file type
- exensive use of 'chords' to preform the same functions as vi
- alse has very accessible macros

### Languages

python

> Python's goal is regularity and readability, not succinctness.
> Paul Prescod

- mandated white space formatting
- very intuitive
- attaches to everything

ruby

> we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming
> Matz

- very intuitive object system based on small talk
- easy to program
- in vogue for web programming although does much more

### Languages

perl

- very powerful regular expression
- cryptic syntax

lisp

- simple but differnt syntax
- code allows itself to be rewritten
- read eval print loop
