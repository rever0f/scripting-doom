### the Lazy

Some people like to work. Some think this is a
horrible idea. These may look at what they are
doing and decide they never want to do it
again. All thats left is to figure out how.

### the Wheel

Given the choice between carrying something and
having something else carry somthing somebody
decided it wasn't their job.

### Language

Given the choice between pantomime and forcing
other people to remember sounds. somebody pounded
sound and symbols into somebody elses head.

### And so on

Somebody decided on a

- transistor
- a circuit
- assembly
- programming and scripting

---
= data-x="2312" data-y="-490" data-scale="0.05"

transistors hold a single charge or binary digit

---
= data-x="2312" data-y="-477" data-scale="0.05"
circuits have collections of connected transistors

---
= data-x="2312" data-y="-464" data-scale="0.05"
assembly translates to binary

---
= data-x="2312" data-y="-452" data-scale="0.05"
programming and scripting translates to assembly

---

### Still working

So somebody decided is wasn't there job and made
something to do it for them. Making programs that
merely repeat these things over and over for
people who would rather have it done elsewhere. So
to do less ... they do more now ... and later they
do it again.

-Program(s/ing) (are/is) for lazy people.

--

-Scripting is for even lazier people.

### Scripting

The difference between scripting and programming
is contested and an actual definition is hard to
come by but generally:

- scripting is easier than coding primarily because it is not compiled.
- compiling is usually a single command or button ... which adds up (^^)
- there are areas where scripting is done regularly and I count roughly 3 of these

### the Server

- servers are just computers generally that do very specific tasks
    - web pages, applications, deliver files etc.
- power users are generally in charge of these computers and find they do many things over and over much like a cook
- to some extent these steps can be written like small recipies that make themselves
- some times these recipies aren't so small ... usually they grow like weeds

### the Program

programs will some times expose certain levels of
thier internal functions so they can be used to
automate tasks.

- small command line programs tend to have everything exposed but thats all they do
- excell/office exposes some but not all of its fuctionality in a very kludgy way and mostly internally
- 3d rendering programs take such commands to preform specific tasks
- some text editors expose every functionality to the user

### Every Where

Scripting languages attempt to expose the entire
computer in an 'easy' way to the user. As more
computers invade our spaces these will become more
and more accessible to scripting.

### Text Editors

Among programmers there is fierce debate about the
one true text bashing device. I suspect most
merely use the one they like and expect others to
do the same. However, to established text editors
there are intrinsic philosophies. Most have been
watered down over time. We will be looking at
extensible text editors.

### vi

vi is according to wikipedia the shortest
unambigous abbreviation for visual in ex an even
more ancient text editor. vi has descended through
many incarnations to be most popular in vim.

- philosopy
- key power
- modes
- scripting
- macros

= data-x="2567" data-y="-1500" data-z="-2062" data-rotate-y="-225" data-scale=".5"
### vi

- originally derived its philosopy from being small and fast and powerful ala unix
- derives its power from shortest keystrokes
- in vi there are several modes that make all the keys do diffent things
- it uses a scripting language based on c syntax, c is an old programing language
- very accessible macros as well which limit the need for scripting

### emacs

emacs borrows letters from Editable MACroS and was
written to edit code directly as its inspiration
did. It has also had several incarnations and is
most poplar in its gnu emacs form.

- philosophy
- scripting
- modes
- chords
- macros

http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/

---
= data-x="2717" data-y="-1600" data-z="-952" data-rotate-y="-270" data-scale=".5"
### emacs

- it derives its philosopy from being powerful and exposing all its self-documenting features ala ai
- it uses what is traditionally called the kitchen sink methodology and preforms a raft of tasks besides text editing
- it uses a form of lisp, a very old and powerful programming language
- has another form of modes based of file type
- extensive use of 'chords' to preform the same functions as vi
- also has very accessible macros

### ruby
> we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming
>
> Matz

- very intuitive object system based on small talk
- easy to program
- in vogue for web programming although does much more

### javascript

- lingua franca of the web
- client and server side now
- html5 doom

---
= data-x="985" data-y="-1601" data-z="-150" data-rotate-y="-360" data-scale='.27'
### lisp

- simple but different syntax
- code allows itself to be rewritten
- read eval print loop

### what am i

i was written in a modified form of markdown and
then converted with ruby to html and javascript.
