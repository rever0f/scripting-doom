#### scripting doom

this is a presentation i gave on scripting in the
recent past (201304|05). it is in theory an
intro/history to the concept of scripting. it may
even make sense(^^).

it is compiled from markdown through [mdpress][1]
to html and javascript utilizing [impress.js][2].

    cd scripting-doom
    mdpress -s darkcookie sdoom-im.md
    cp *jpg sdoom-im

it is also already compiled in sdoom-im folder,
the folder is a mess of versions due to the fact
it wasn't originally version controlled. this is
intended for me.
